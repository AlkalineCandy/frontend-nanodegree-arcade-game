**Front-end Nanodegree Homework by Udacity**

Minimalistic version of the homework project. 

**Game begins** with the player on the grassy fields. Player needs to cross the river with the _arrow keys_ and player **wins** if s/he manages to reach the other side without hitting the bugs.

The win scenario then shows up and the player can restart the game with F5 because I was in a rush to finish this project. 

Forked from Udacity, see more information there.
